I wrote my first Ruby gem, [AmazonBundler](https://github.com/bobbymeyer/amazon_bundler).

AmazonBundler is a simple tool for Amazon Affiliates. It allows you to easily bundle multiple items from Amazon into a single, convenient package with just one click.

To use the gem, simply provide it with an array of Amazon ASINs and corresponding quantities for the items you want to bundle. The gem will then generate links that allow users to add all of the items in the bundle to their Amazon cart with a single click.
