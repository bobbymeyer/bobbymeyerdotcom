Welcome to my digital halftone generator, inspired by the charm of vintage newspapers! This interactive tool allows you to transform images into a halftone pattern, a technique traditionally used in print media to represent images using dots of varying sizes.

To begin, simply upload an image of your choice. Once uploaded, the tool will automatically adjust the image for optimal contrast, turning it into a striking black and white halftone masterpiece.

You also have the flexibility to adjust the density of the halftone pattern using the dropdown menu provided.
